HALF-MINIMUM IMPUTATION ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

Algorithm: Half-Minimum (Domain-Specific Baseline)

Method Description:
  - Assumes missing values are below detection limit
  - Imputes with 50% of minimum detected value per feature
  - Simple, fast, domain-specific approach

Dataset Information:
  Total features: 241
  Total samples: 146
  Biological groups: ['LC', 'NC', 'PTB', 'QC']

Validation Results (Cross-validation):
  RMSE: 1545362.7703 +/- 98727.0882
  MAE:  300973.4942 +/- 14847.1202
  R2:   0.4764 +/- 0.0155
  Correlation: 0.8974 +/- 0.0227

Interpretation:
  Imputation quality needs review (R2=0.476, Corr=0.897)

Note:
  Half-minimum is a simple baseline approach.
  It does not account for:
    - Sample similarity (unlike KNN)
    - Correlation structure (unlike EM/SVD)
    - Non-linear relationships (unlike RF)
  However, it is:
    - Fast and computationally efficient
    - Domain-specific for metabolomics
    - Conservative (doesn't overestimate low values)
